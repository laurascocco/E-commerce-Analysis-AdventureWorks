# E-commerce-Analysis-AdventureWorks

Analysis of the AdventureWorks database, a common sample used for business scenarios. The objective was to examine sales, transactions, quantities sold, and profits.

In the first phase, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed using SQL. This included inspecting the main tables such as Sales, Products, Customers, Resellers, and Geography, understanding their structure, and the relationships between them. Data cleaning involved handling missing values and normalizing data as needed. 

In the second phase, Power BI was used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards with drill-through and tooltips. The focus was on detailed analysis of Sales, Transactions, Quantity, and Profit. Key visualizations included timelines, geographic maps, bar charts and pie charts, alongside KPIs.

This analysis provided a detailed view of AdventureWorks' business performance, allowing the identification of key trends, strengths, and areas for improvement. The combination of EDA with SQL and data visualization with Power BI enabled transforming raw data into useful and visually intuitive insights, facilitating data-driven decision-making to improve sales and marketing strategies
